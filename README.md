# WSA Labs

This repository contains my personal Python scripts and utilities for exploring and solving labs from
[PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).  
The goal is to practice application security concepts hands-on by automating and experimenting with
different attack scenarios.

All official labs can be found here: [PortSwigger Web Security Academy Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs).
